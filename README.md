# im-magic
Remote sensing image processing toolkit

### 1. Introduction
Researchers working on geospatial data usually struggle with
the various projection, resolution, reference of their spatial
data. Although GIS software can solve these issues. But most of
these softwares are not friendly to use when dealing with batch
processing, and it is kind of difficult to standardize data
protocols among researchers within a research group, which can
make it difficult to work on data produced by different person.

To standardize this process within GlaserLab, we implemented 
this im-magic package to help us standardize our raster data
processing workflow. And the package also allows users to
do raster computations.
